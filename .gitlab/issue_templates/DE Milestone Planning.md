# Engineering Days :calendar: 
Please add a number for days you'll be working this milestone. Engineers should subtract a day for each triage day and a day for meetings. Any time-off should also be subtracted from this number. This means that the maximum Engineering Days a Data Engineer will ever post is 7. If you have two triage days it's 5. **This section should be filled out by the data engineers themselves.**

# Velocity and Capacity :race_car: 
We calculate the velocity of our last milestone by dividing the points/weight completed by the number of engineering days that were available. **This section should be filled out by the data engineering team manager or whoever is running the planning**

## Last Milestone
Last Milestone: <!-- link here (it will probably be the current milestone) -->
Last Milestone Issue: <!-- link here and also relate it in the linked issues section below-->
* **Last milestone weight completed:** <!-- from 'Last Milestone' linked above -->
* **Last milestone engineering days:** <!-- from 'Last Milestone Issue' linked above -->
* **Last milestone velocity:** <!-- 'Last milestone weight completed' / 'Last milestone engineering days' -->


## This (starting) Milestone: :crystal_ball: 
We assume that preceding milestone's velocity is a good predictor of the following milestone's velocity. We then make sure that we have adequate capacity to address all of the **prioritized issues**. If we don't have enough capacity then we remove the issues of least priority. 

**Engineering capacity for this milestone:** <!-- Total engineering days * Last milestone velocity -->
