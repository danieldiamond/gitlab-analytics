# `YY.MM.DD - DA` Planning 

SSOT for `YY.MM.DD` work: [Data Analytics board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-data/-/boards/1587810?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&milestone_title=YY.MM.DD%20-%20DA%20(current)). 

Please bookmark and use this board to work from in priority order. 

This issue should be opened at:
- the earliest on the Thursday before the milestone. 
- the latest on the Monday before the milestone. 

## Announcements
This section contains information on events that could affect several members of the team and the capacity. (Ex: company conferences, world events, etc...)

## Capacity :weight_lifter: 

How is `capacity` calculated? 
* Identify number of days (decimal - divide by 8)
* Convert days to weights 
* Divide by total weights of issues 


### Available Time :calendar: 
Please add a number of days (decimal) you'll be working this milestone. 
Guidelines: 
1. Each milestone has 10 days. 
1. Remove days/hours for leave: holiday, conference, etc... 
1. Remove two day for data triage, data team meetings, grooming issues, and planning. 
    - If you have multiple data triage days, please remove an additional day per triage day. 
1. Remove hours based on any additional meetings.

## Retrospective (to be completed during Data Ops before the next milestone)

[Milestone Retrospectives](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective) are important because they allow for an opportunity to reflect on the work that was done - celebrating the success - while identifying areas of improvement. 
By the end of the retrospective, the team should identify improvements to commit to in the next milestone to improve their experience through the milestones.  

### What went well in the milestone 

### What could be improved 

### What we commit to improve in the next milestone
