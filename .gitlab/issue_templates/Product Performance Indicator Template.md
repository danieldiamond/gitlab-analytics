### üß©Answer these questions to provide more context

- Does your feature play a bigger role in initial purchase, retention, or expansion/upgrade?

- What are some dimensions you would expect to slice/dice your Product Performance Indicators? For example, by plan tier, by free/paid, etc. 
- Are there any GitLab product features that are "downstream" or "upstream" to your product feature? For example, customers have to use feature A to use your feature, or once customers use your feature, they are more likely to use another feature.
