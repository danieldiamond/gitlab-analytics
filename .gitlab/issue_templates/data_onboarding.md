## Overview 

Goal: To help bring you, our new data team member, up to speed in the GitLab Data Team's analytics stack as efficiently as possible, without sacrificing quality for speed. There is a lot of information in the on-boarding issue, so please bookmark handbook pages, documentation pages, and log-ins for future reference. The goal is for you to complete and close the Data Team on-boarding issue within 1 week after you have completed the GitLab company on-boarding issue. These resources will be super helpful and serve as great reference material as you get up to speed and learn to work through issues and merge requests [over your first 90 day](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/source/job-families/finance/data-analyst/index.html.md#how-youll-ramp).

   - [ ] Engineers, join `analytics-pipelines`
   - [ ] Analytsts, join `dbt-runs`
- [ ] Schedule a recurring fortnightly 1:1 meeting with the Director of Business Operations.
- [ ] Invite yourself to the to Milestone Planning/Grooming and DataOps Meetings from the Data Team Calendar. To do this, update the invitation to include your email address; don't just copy the event to your calendar.
- [ ] Schedule a coffee chat with each member of the team. These should be in addition to the ones you do with other GitLab team members.
- [ ] Read the following pages of the handbook in their entirety. Bookmark them as you should soon be making MR's to improve our documentation!
   - [ ] [Data Team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/)
   - [ ] [Business Operations](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/)
   - [ ] [Data Quality Process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-quality-process/)
   - [ ] [Periscope Directory](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/periscope-directory/)
- [ ] Watch @tlapiana's [talk at DataEngConf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu623QBwakc) that gives a phenomenal overview of how the team works.
- [ ] Watch [this great talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prcz0ubTAAg) on what Analytics is
- [ ] Update the [Time Blackout Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-L1l1x0uayj-bA_U9ETt2w12rC8SqC5mHP7Aa-rkmsY/edit#gid=0); add a new column, and make sure you don't break any formulas!
- [ ] Try running `/gitlab datachat run hello-world` in Slack in the #data team channel. You may be prompted to authenticate! Do it! (Sometimes we run [chatops](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/chatops/) to help with testing.)
- [ ] If relevant, watch ["The State of [Product] Data"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNLkj3Ho2bk&feature=youtu.be) from Eli at the Growth Fastboot. (You'll need to be logged into GitLab Unfiltered.)

There is a lot of information being thrown at you over the last couple of days. 
It can all feel a bit overwhelming. 
The way we work at GitLab is unique and can be the hardest part of coming on board. 
It is really important to internalize that we work **handbook-first** and that **everything is always a work in progress**. 
Please watch one minute of [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqzDY76Q8Eo&feature=youtu.be&t=7511) (you will need to be logged into GitLab unfiltered) where Sid gives a great example of why its important that we work this way. 
*This is the most important thing to learn during all of onboarding.*  

**Getting your computer set up locally**
* Make sure that you have [created your SSH keys](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/create-your-ssh-keys.html) prior to running this. You can check this by typing `ssh -T git@gitlab.com` into your terminal which should return "Welcome to GitLab, " + your_username
* THE NEXT STEPS SHOULD ONLY BE RUN ON YOUR GITLAB-ISSUED LAPTOP. If you run this on your personal computer, we take no responsibility for the side effects. 
* [ ] Open your computer's built-in terminal app. Run the following:
```
curl https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/raw/master/admin/onboarding_script.sh > ~/onboarding_script.sh
bash ~/onboarding_script.sh
rm ~/onboarding_script.sh
```
   * This may take a while, and it might ask you for your password (multiple times) before it's done. Here's what this does:
      * Installs iTerm, a mac-OS terminal replacement
      * Installs Atom, an open source text editor. Atom is reccomended because of its support for dbt autocompletion.
      * Installs docker so you can work out of containers.
      * Installing dbt, the open source tool we use for data transformations.
      * Installing goto, an easy way to move through the file system. [Please find here more details on how to use goto](https://github.com/iridakos/goto)
      * Installing anaconda, how we recommend folks get their python distribution.
   * You will be able to `goto analytics` from anywhere to go to the analytics repo locally (you will have to open a new terminal window for `goto` to start working.) If it doesn't work, try running `goto -r analytics ~/repos/analytics` then quit + reopen your terminal before trying again.
   * You will be able to `gl_open` from anywhere within the analytics project to open the repo in the UI. If doesn't work, visually inspect your `~/.bashrc` file to make sure it has [this line](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/blob/master/admin/make_life_easier.sh#L14). 
   * Your default python version should now be python 3. Typing `which python` into a new terminal window should now return `/usr/local/anaconda3/bin/python`
   * dbt will be installed at its latest version. Typing `dbt --version` will output the current version.
* [ ] We strongly recommend configuring Atom (via the Atom UI) with the [Atom setup](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-set-up-our-computers-for-working-on-dbt-projects/243?) section of Claire's post and [adding the tip](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-set-up-our-computers-for-working-on-dbt-projects/243/5) from jars later in the thread. It will make your life much easier.
  * Your editor should be configured so that all tabs are converted to 4 spaces. This will minimize messy looking diffs and provide consistency across the team.
    * VSCode
      * `Editor: Detect Indentation` is deselected
      * `Editor: Insert Spaces` is selected
      * `Editor: Tab Size` is set to 4 spaces per tab


Our data stack looks roughly like this:
<img src = "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*BogoeTTK1OXFU1hPfUyCFw.png">

As you read in the handbook, we currently use Stitch for extracting data from its raw sources and loading it into our Snowflake data warehouse. We use open source dbt (more on this in a moment) as our transformation tool. The bulk of your projects and tasks will be in dbt , so we will spend a lot of time familiarizing yourself with those tools and then dig into specific data sources.

**Bonus**
To see the inspiration for the onboarding script you just ran, take a look at the dbt Discourse post [here](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-set-up-our-computers-for-working-on-dbt-projects/243) on how they set up their computers for working on dbt projects. You might want to do some of the additional configurations mentioned in that post.

## Connecting to Snowflake
- [ ] Login with the credentials that your manager created following the instructions at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/#warehouse-access
- [ ] Snowflake has a Web UI for querying the data warehouse that can be found under [Worksheets](https://gitlab.snowflakecomputing.com/console#/internal/worksheet). Familiarize yourself with it.  Update your role, warehouse, and database to the same info you're instructed to put in your dbt profile (Ask your manager if this is confusing). The schema does not matter because your query will reference the schema.
- [ ] Run `alter user "your_user" set default_role = "your_role";` to set the UI default Role to your appropriate role instead of `PUBLIC`
   - [ ] We STRONGLY recommend using the UI, but if you must download a SQL development tool, you will need one that is compatible with Snowflake, such as [SQLWorkbench/J](http://sql-workbench.net) or [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/). If you're interested in DataGrip, follow the [instructions to get a JetBrains license in the handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/#jetbrains). If using DataGrip, you may need to download the [Driver](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/jdbc-download.html#downloading-the-driver). This template may be useful as you're configuring the DataGrip connection to Snowflake `jdbc:snowflake://{account:param}.snowflakecomputing.com/?{password}[&db={Database:param}][&warehouse={Warehouse:param}][&role={Role:param}]` We recommend not setting your schema so you can select from the many options. If you do use Data Grip, please set up the following configuration:

#### Data Grip Configuration
Change your formatting preferences in Data Grip by going to Preferences > Editor > Code Style > HTML.
You should have:

* Use tab character: unchecked
* Tab size: 4
* Indent: 4
* Continuation indent: 8
* Keep indents on empty lines: unchecked

You can use `Command + Option + L` to format your file.

### What is dbt?
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), which we use for transformations in the data warehouse, as it gives us a way to source control the SQL.
- [ ] Refer to http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/ as a resource for understanding Jinja which is used extensively in dbt.
- [ ] [This article](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com/what-exactly-is-dbt-47ba57309068) talks about the what/why.
- [ ] [This introduction](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction) should help get you understand what dbt is.
- [ ] [This podcast](https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/dbt-data-analytics-episode-81/) is a general walkthrough of dbt/interview with its creator, Drew Banin.
- [ ] Read [how we use dbt](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/#-transformation) and our [SQL Style Guide](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/sql-style-guide/).
- [ ] Watch [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZuieqqejDd2HkvhEZeOPd6f2Vd5JWyUn/view) of Taylor introducing Chase to dbt.
- [ ] Watch [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NQ9qHnsyQ&feature=youtu.be) of Thomas and Israel discussing getting started with dbt locally.
- [ ] Peruse the [Official Docs](https://docs.getdbt.com).
- [ ] In addition to using dbt to manage our transformations, we use dbt to maintain [our own internal documentation](https://gitlab-data.gitlab.io/analytics/dbt/snowflake/#!/overview) on those data transformations. This is a public link. We suggest bookmarking it.
- [ ] Read about and and watch [Drew demo dbt docs to Emilie & Taylor](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com/using-dbt-docs-fae6137da3c3). Read about [Scaling Knowledge](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com/scaling-knowledge-160f9f5a9b6c) and the problem we're trying to solve with our documentation.
- [ ] Consider joining [dbt slack](https://slack.getdbt.com) (Not required, but strongly recommended; if you join use your personal email).
- [ ] Information and troubleshooting on dbt is sparse on Google & Stack Overflow, we recommend the following sources of help when you need it:
   * Your teammates! We are all here to help!
   * dbt slack has a #beginners channel and they are very helpful.
   * [Fishtown Analytics Blog](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com)
   * [dbt Discourse](http://discourse.getdbt.com)


### Getting Set up with dbt locally
- All dbt commands need to be run within the `dbt-image` docker container
- To get into the `dbt-image` docker container, go to the analytics project (which you can get to by typing `goto analytics` from anywhere on your Mac) and run the command `make dbt-image`. This will spin up our docker container that contains `dbt` and give you a bash shell within the `analytics/transform/snowflake-dbt` directory.
- All changes made to the files within the `analytics` repo will automatically be visible in the docker container! This container is only used to run `dbt` commands themselves, not to write SQL or edit `dbt` files in general (though technically it could be, as VIM is available within the container)
- [ ] From a different terminal window run `atom ~/.dbt/profiles.yml` and update this file with your info.
- [ ] Run `dbt compile` from within the container to know that your connection has been successful, you are in the correct location, and everything will run smoothly.
- [ ] test the command `make help` and use it to understand how to use `make dbt-docs` and access it from your local machine.

Here is your dbt commands cheat sheet:
 * `dbt compile` - compiles all models
 * `dbt run` - regular run
 * `dbt run --models modelname` - will only run modelname
 * `dbt run --models +modelname` - will run modelname and all the models it depends on
 * `dbt run --models modelname+` - will run modelname and all the models that depend on it
 * `dbt run --models +modelname+` - will run modelname, all the models it depends on, and all the models that depend on it
 * `dbt run --exclude modelname` - will run all models except modelname
 * `dbt run --full-refresh` - will refresh incremental models
 * `dbt test` - will run custom data tests and schema tests; TIP: `dbt test` takes the same `--model` and `--exclude` syntax referenced for `dbt run`
 * `dbt_run_changed` - a function we've added to your computer that only runs models that have changed (this is accessible from within the docker container)
 * `cycle_logs` - a function we've added to your computer to clear out the dbt logs (not accessible from within the docker container)
 * `make dbt-docs` - a command that will spin up a local container to serve you the `dbt` docs in a web-browser, found at `localhost:8081`

## Snowflake SQL
Snowflake SQL is probably not that different from the dialects of SQL you're already familiar with, but here are a couple of resources to point you in the right direction:
- [ ] [Differences we found while transition from Postgres to Snowflake](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/issues/645)
- [ ] [How Compatible are Redshift and Snowflake’s SQL Syntaxes?](https://medium.com/@jthandy/how-compatible-are-redshift-and-snowflakes-sql-syntaxes-c2103a43ae84)
- [ ] [Snowflake Functions](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/functions-all.html)

## Misc
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with the [Stitch](http://stitchdata.com) UI, as this is mostly the source of truth for what data we are loading. An email will have been sent with info on how to get logged in.
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with GitLab CI https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/ and our running pipelines.
- [ ] Consider joining [Locally Optimistic slack](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/community/)
 (Not required, but recommended).
- [ ] Consider subscribing to the [Data Science Roundup](http://roundup.fishtownanalytics.com) (Not required, but recommended).
- [ ] There are many Slack channels organized around interests, such as `#fitlab`, `#bookclub`, and `#woodworking`. There are also many organized by location (these all start with `#loc_`). This is a great way to connect to GitLabbers outside of the team. Join some that are relevant to your interests, if you'd like.
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with [SheetLoad](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/#using-sheetload).
- [ ] Really really useful resources in [this Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wrI_7v0HwCwd-o1ryTv5dlh6GW_JyrSQ?usp=sharing) (GitLab Internal); Read the `a_README` file first.
