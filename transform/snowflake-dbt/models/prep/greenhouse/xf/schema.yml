The fields are the same as greenhouse_stage_intermediate but we have removed application_id and candidate_id and changed dates to month format.

  
  - name: greenhouse_sourcer
    description: This model is used to identify who the sourcer is for candidates. This is specific to source type = 'Prospecting'

  - name: greenhouse_hires

        - name: hire_date_mod
          description: Note - this is a calculated field. In the case we don't have the candidate target hire date we are using the first record from the employment status table. If we do then we factor in the time between the candidate target hire and the bamboo hire date, and if it is less than 120 days we use the bamboo hire date, otherwise the targer_hire (the reason for this is because we don't have every application record for candidates hired prior to greenhouse. If this is the 2+ hired record in greenhouse we use the candidate target hire date as this candidate is a transfer.
        - name: hire_type
          description: Indicates whether the candidate is a hire, rehire, or transfer based on greenhouse_candidate_row_number.
