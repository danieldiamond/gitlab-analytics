  - name: greenhouse_diversity
    description: Provides a breakdown of recruiting KPIs by gender, as well as department and division breakouts. Note - the values for the columns in this model will be null in the case there are less than 3 candidates for a given eeoc pool (this is done using the min over partition value).
    columns:
    - name: month_date
    - name: breakout_type
      description: This column indicates what the metric data is displayed at the KPI level (not accounting for eeoc values), division level, or all (accounting for division and department).
      tests:
        - accepted_values:
            values: ['kpi_level_breakout','all_attributes_breakout','eeoc_only_breakout','division_breakout','department_division_breakout']  
    - name: department_name
    - name: division
    - name: eeoc_field_name
      description: This column identifies what the eeoc_value is for. For example, the possible eeoc_values for eeoc_field_name = 'candidate_gender' are male, female and did not identify. In the case, the eeoc_field_name is na it is because the breakout_type is a KPI level, and we are not looking to aggregate for diversity fields.
      tests: 
        - accepted_values:
            values: ['candidate_veteran_status', 'candidate_gender', 'candidate_status', 'candidate_race', 'candidate_disability_status','na']
    - name: eeoc_values
      description: This is associated to the eeoc_field_name. For eeoc_field_name = 'candidate_gender' there will be a row for each of the values (male, female, and decline to self identify). This allows us to create a base model with all the potential eeoc_field_values for each field_column and join all applicants even those that don't identify.
