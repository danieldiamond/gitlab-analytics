          description: Shows how long an applicant to go from applying to accepting an offer. This is based on offer accept month.

  - name: greenhouse_diversity_intermediate
    description: This is the intermediate model used for greenhouse_diversity. It builds out a base that includes month_date, a column for all the various eeoc_field_names, and joins greenhouse_recruiting_xf to ensure each candidate is tied to an eeoc_field. In the event the candidate did not answer, the response is 'Did not identify'. This is later used in the greenhouse_diversity rpt to aggregate metrics.
    columns:
        - name: month_date
        - name: eeoc_field_name
          description: This column lists the eeoc_fields and ties it to each application. As a result, an applicant will have a response for gender, race, etc if it is null.           
          tests:
            - not_null
            - accepted_values:
                    values: [candidate_veteran_status', 'candidate_gender', 'candidate_status', 'candidate_race', 'candidate_disability_status','no_eeoc']
        - name: capture_month
          description: This identifies if the data is captured for the application month, the offer sent month, or offer_accepted. The metrics associated to these are grouped up in the greenhouse_diversity rpt.

            - not_null

        - name: accepted_offer
          description: If the offer_status = 'accepted' then this will be a 1, otherwise 0. This is used later to aggregate offers in the greenhouse_diversity model.
