# So a test has failed!

This document exists to capture common fixes for problems that may be surfaced by our dbt test suite.

You will find the below document organized by test name, containing all documented errors for that test.

**Most tests are meant to capture data quality concerns, so it's more important to investigate the cause of the failure than it is to remove the failure.**

## Types of test

There are two types of tests, `custom data tests` and `schema tests`.

You can tell which kind of test this error was surfaced from by looking at the path at the end of the error message, if `tests/data_test/*`
this is a `custom data test` which is defined as a .sql file in the `tests` folder, the compiled sql will be found in your `target/compiled/gitlab_snowflake/data_test` or `target/compiled/snowplow/data_test` folder.

If it's `models/*` this is a `schema test` and is defined in the `schema.yml` file on the model's folder and the compiled sql in the `target/compiled/gitlab_snowflake/schema_test` or `target/compiled/snowplow/schema_test` folder.


## General Checklist:
1. Make sure you are running the compiled code behind the test against `analytics` instead of your development schema
2. Verify that the error is valid by reviewing the data that is surfacing the error in the following order of priorities: test-failure --> model that was built powering test --> base model --> raw data
3. Go to the front-end of the data source and validate that it is not a data pipeline error
4. Create an issue in the Primary Data Project. If the issue needs to contain customer names or other private information ensure the issue is confidential

## Schema Tests

###  Relationship Tests
Relationship tests are a type of schema test that check for referential integrity ([dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/testing#section-relationships)). The purpose of a relationship test is to "validate that all of the records in a child table have a corresponding record in a parent table."

For example, you might have a (child) table called `merge_requests` with a column called `author_id`. A good relationship test would be to test that every value in `merge_requests.author_id` is present in a different (parent) table called `users`.

When a relationship test fails, the error message will look like:
```
Failure in test relationships_childModel_childColumn__parentColumn__parentModel_ (models/../../schema.yml)
  Got 2 results, expected 0.
```

Steps to debug:
1. Confirm the failing test is a real failure by querying the parent table for the missing value(s).
2. Confirm that the missing records are not being filtered out in a previous dbt model (check the base models).
3. Try to narrow the problem down. The records are missing from the child table for 1 of 3 reasons:
i. The data pipeline is broken (Example: Stitch hasn't loaded fresh data in 7 days. Solution: talk to data-eng)
ii. The data is missing at the source (Example: somebody from sales forgot to fill out a field in Salesforce. Solution: ask sales to fix it)
iii. The test isn't actually valid (Example: you realize that it's actually okay for the child to reference a parent that doesn't exist. Solution: remove the test)


### Models : `sfdc_users_archived` and `sfdc_account_archived`

The failing tests are the following:

```
tests:
  - dbt_utils.recency:
      datepart: day
      field: dbt_last_updated_timestamp
      interval: 1
```

These schema tests assert that `dbt archive` has run successfully and the last inserted data in `sfdc_users_archived` and `sfdc_account_archived` tables are less than 24 hours old.

These tests are failing when `dbt test` is run before `dbt archive`. So dbt tests freshness of the data of the archived tables before the archivals are actually finished.

Nothing is expected from triager when this happens for the moment. [An issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/issues/1725) has been opened to make snapshots more robust.

Error Example:

```
Failure in test recency_sfdc_account_archived_day__dbt_last_updated_timestamp__1 (models/sfdc/base/schema.yml)\x1b[0m\n'

Got 1 results, expected 0.

compiled SQL at target/compiled/dbt_utils/schema_test/recency_sfdc_account_archived_f4f936fbfa6592180d13b0c5befeafac.sql

```

### Model: snowplow

Most snowplow errors can be resolved by triggering a full dbt refresh as the models are incremental, but sometimes have late-arriving events. Request a full refresh to @tmurphy in the #analytics-pipelines Slack channel.

Snowplow contains models and tests that are baked in from a Package (docs [can be found here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/snowplow)), so make sure
to check the compiled test (path found in the `compiled SQL` section of the error message) for test evaluation.

Error Example:

```
Failure in test relationships_snowplow_web_events_time_page_view_id__page_view_id__ref_snowplow_web_page_context_ (models/page_views/schema.yml)
  Got 15164 results, expected 0.

  compiled SQL at target/compiled/snowplow/schema_test/relationships_snowplow_web_events_time_4183e7f72f68f16d48e4f78cd66a9c48.sql
```

## Custom Data Tests

### Test: current_depts_and_divs

This test makes sure there are no current employees who don't have a division, department, or cost center.
The output is the row for the employee which does not have a department or division.
If this test fails, ping the People Operations team with the employee's name.
You will need to temporarily filter out the problematic candidate while it is resolved upstream.
Alternatively, it's possible the cost center is missing from the csv file (loaded using dbt seed).

### Test: no_missing_location_factors

This test makes sure that new hires have a location factor no later than 7 days after their start date. It is checking to make sure that for all active employees (`AND termination_date IS NULL`) within 7 days of their start date (`AND CURRENT_DATE > dateadd('days', 7, hire_date)`) have a `hire_location_factor` (the location factor on their hire date). When this is not the case, we need to alert the People Operations Analyst with the employee number.

Error example:
```
Completed with 1 errors:

Failure in test no_missing_location_factors (tests/bamboohr/data_test/no_missing_location_factors.sql)
  Got 2 results, expected 0.

  compiled SQL at target/compiled/gitlab_snowflake/bamboohr/data_test/no_missing_location_factors.sql
```

Steps to resolve:
* Step 1: Run the chatops command `/gitlab datachat run missing_location_factor` from Slack to see the test results in Slack.
* Step 2: Ping the People Operations Analyst with the employee ID numbers that are missing location factor in #data. (AS of 2019-07-24, that would be Morgan Wilkins.)
* Step 3: Filter out the employee by employee number in the `employee_directory` model and submit your MR for review. Create a subsequent issue around unfiltering the employee and assign it to the next milestone.
* Step 4: Once PO has confirmed that they've been updated (it is on you to follow up with PO even after your triage day!), unfilter the employee.

### Test: uncategorized_version_usage_stats
This test checks that the list of unique ping metrics that we receive, `version_usage_stats_list`, matches the ping metrics that we have categorized in the static CSV, `version_usage_stats_to_stage_mappings`. This test will fail when these two sources get out of sync in either direction.

Error Example:
```
Database Error in model version_usage_data_monthly_change_by_stage (models/version/xf/version_usage_data_monthly_change_by_stage.sql)
  000904 (42000): 018c7f13-0141-8466-0000-289d05dda8ae: SQL compilation error: error line 397 at position 24
  invalid identifier 'PINGS.OPERATIONS_DASHBOARD_DEFAULT_DASHBOARD_CHANGE'
  compiled SQL at target/compiled/gitlab_snowflake/version/xf/version_usage_data_monthly_change_by_stage.sql
```

Steps to Resolve:

* Step 1: Run the chatops command `/gitlab datachat run uncategorized_pings` from Slack to see the test results in Slack.
* Step 2: Create a new issue.
* Step 3: Ask in the #product slack channel which stage the new metric belongs to.
* Step 4: Create an MR that adds the new metric to the `version_usage_stats_to_stage_mappings` CSV. Remember to keep it sorted alphabetically.

### Test: zuora_account_has_crm_id

Error Example:
```
Failure in test zuora_account_has_crm_id (tests/data_test/zuora_account_has_crm_id.sql)
  Got 1 results, expected 0.

  compiled SQL at target/compiled/gitlab_snowflake/data_test/zuora_account_has_crm_id.sql

```

Steps to Resolve:

* Step 1: Run the chatops command `/gitlab datachat run zuora_crm_id` from Slack to see the test results in Slack.
* Step 2: Create an issue in finance asking the account get updated with a salesforce_id. Cross link this to the analytics issue
* Step 3: Create an issue to remove the filter and assign it to the next milestone, cross-link it to the original issue
* Step 4: Add the zuora account_id in the [zuora_excluded_accounts seed file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/blob/master/transform/snowflake-dbt/data/zuora/zuora_excluded_accounts.sql) and submit your MR for review
* Step 5: Once finance has confirmed that the account has been updated, create a MR to remove the filter


### Test: zuora_assert_single_ult_parent
Error Example:
```
Failure in test zuora_assert_single_ult_parent (tests/data_test/zuora_assert_single_ult_parent.sql)
  Got 1 results, expected 0.

  compiled SQL at target/compiled/gitlab_snowflake/data_test/zuora_assert_single_ult_parent.sql
```

Steps to Resolve:

* Step 1: Follow the general checklist
* Step 2: Create an issue in finance asking for the Zuora account and subscription linkages to be reviewed.
* Step 3: Create an issue to remove the filter and assign it to the next milestone, cross-link it to the original issue.
* Step 4: Filter out the zuora subscription in the test based on the md5 hash of the subscription name.
* Step 5: Once finance has confirmed that the accounts and subscriptions have been updated, create a MR to remove the filter.

### Test: zuora_assert_no_circular_linkages

This custom test asserts `zuora_subscription_intermediate` has no circular linkage. A circular linkage is created when the `zuora_renewal_subscription_name_slugify` is equal to the `subscription_name_slugify` in the `zuora_subscription_intermediate`.

When the test fails, the `zuora_subscription_lineage` model will fail with the following error:
```
Database Error in model zuora_subscription_lineage (models/zuora/xf/zuora_subscription_lineage.sql)
  100189 (22000): 018d9a6c-01bb-a7c9-0000-289d0753e48e: Recursion exceeded max iteration count (100).
```


Steps to Resolve:

* Step 1: Follow the general checklist
* Step 2: Create an issue in finance asking for the Zuora subscription lineage to be reviewed.
* Step 3: Create an issue to remove the filter and assign it to the next milestone, cross-link it to the original issue
* Step 4: Filter out the zuora account in the base `zuora_subscription` model and submit your MR for review
  * We filter from the base model instead of the test because downstream models (such as retention) will fail otherwise
* Step 5: Once finance has confirmed that the account has been updated, create a MR to remove the filter

### Test: zuora_renewal_subscription_date_range

-----------
Error Example:
```
Failure in test zuora_renewal_subscription_date_range (tests/data_test/zuora_renewal_subscription_date_range.sql)
  Got 1 results, expected 0.

  compiled SQL at target/compiled/gitlab_snowflake/data_test/zuora_renewal_subscription_date_range.sq
```

Steps to Resolve:

* Step 1: Follow the general checklist
* Step 2: Create an issue in finance informing of the error and asking the account be updated. Cross link this to the analytics issue
* Step 3: Create an issue to remove the filter and assign it to the next milestone, cross-link it to the original issue
* Step 4: Filter out the zuora account in the base `zuora_account` model and submit your MR for review
  * We filter from the base model instead of the test because downstream models (such as retention) rely on every account having accurate data.
* Step 5: Once finance has confirmed that the account has been updated, create a MR to remove the filter
-----------

### Test: zuora_discount_accounts_are_excluded
This tests that all zuora rate plan charges that used a particular internal discount are removed from the zuora base models. 

Steps to Resolve:
* Step 1: Confirm with finance that the account_id is indeed coming from an internal account and was meant for testing.
* Step 2: Make an MR adding the account_id to the `zuora_excluded_accounts.csv` seed file with `is_permanently_excluded` set to TRUE and the account name as the description.
